### Code walkthrough
The frontend folder contains all the javascript and React/Flux elements of this website. A flux structure was used throughout this project. The only HTML served by the rails app can be seen in `app/views/static_pages/root.html.erb`. It contains only this:

```
<div id="content"></div>
```

React does the rest. Rails is used on the backend to serve content from the database, such as restaurants and reservations. Of particular interest is the reservation model, which is the backbone of this app. In `/models/reservation.rb` you'll see the validations that go into creating a reservation that doesn't conflict with any others. As you're making reservations on the site, pay attention to the times that are returned. You may notice certain 15 minute blocks have been skipped.

### How to use the app
The app starts the user off with a choice of what city they are looking to dine in. After choosing a city, the user is given a choice of restaurants in that city, with price information on the right hand side of the page.

Once on a restaurant page, the user selects from a number of filters to find an open table. Every restaurant has a max number of diners it will accept from Table, so you won't be able to book if the time you chose has too many people booked already. To handle this, the user is provided with 5 options within 90 minutes of the provided search time.

After selecting a reservation option, the user has one more chance to cancel before they submit. After submittal, the reservation will be available to view in the users profile page, accessible from the header at the top of the page.
